        <h2 class="header sticky-header"><u>What's Dreamscape?</u></h2>
            <p class="par"> Dreamscape is a game idea that I thought about in my senior year of High School. Ideas have been replaced, returned to, erased, etc., but nothing solid has been confirmed. I am still writing the story, but I do have a early draft idea (written), it is as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="bq"><u><b>Synopsis:</b></u> Dreamscape is a game about 2 friends traversing in each other's minds after an experiment gone wrong. After inventing a machine that allows you to record your dreams while you sleep, the two friends test it, however it fails and instead puts the friends to sleep. They switch minds (like friend 1 sees friend 2’s dream while they sleep and vice versa, they’re both asleep tho). In order to get out, they must interact with characters from each other’s dreams and keep from panicking. Additionally, they must also go through secrets, desires, fears, and insecurities in order to wake up. Dreamscape is a first-person, choice-based, puzzle game. As you progress through the story, your choices will affect how the story plays out, so be wise.
                    </p>

            <p class="par"> Originally I was going to make this game on the Roblox platform, although I thought it would be best to make it its own standalone game, but also not use the Roblox Engine. The idea before this was to make the game into a Visual Interactive Novel, with the RenPy Engine. Using Python, I wanted to create a story game like "Doki Doki Literature Club", although as I mention later in "The Mechanics", I had more visions and plans for how I want the game to play out and feel.</p>
            <p class="par"> Here you will find a link to the very early draft of a "script" (abandoned since no longer doing it in RenPy), but I want to maintain the same idea.</p>

        <!--The Mechanics-->
        <h2 class="header sticky-header"><u>The Mechanics</u></h2>
            <p class="par">The plan so far is that the game will be in a cartoon-like 3D game. Will be filled with tons of dialogue, somewhat open world. Will be made up of puzzles, and mazes, and at times, just random sandbox-like environment. The player will initially be greeted by a cutscene where the two main characters are interacting, opening the scene for the story. Considering that this game will mostly be story-driven, (like the games "Quantum Break" and "Detroit: Become Human"), I want Dreamscape to be full of constant user interaction (like the "Quick Time Events" in video games).</p>
            <p class="par"> In the game "Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War", near the end of the campaign, the protagonist is being interrogated by another protagonist and it's constant back and forth of flashbacks. I want to implement something like this at some point in the game, considering that one of the core ideas of the game is that it deals with dreams and flashbacks.</p>
            <p class="par"> In the game "Quantum Break", there is one mechanic where the player gets to choose different ways to alter "time", either through freezing time, slowing down time in the player's immediate area, or throwing something that makes the target move in slow motion (or freezes it for a short period of time). To implement such ideas into DreamScape, I want there to be levels where the player will have to navigate the world and carefully choose how to interact with their surroundings to unlock paths, and interact with dream figures in the environment.</p>

         <!--Update-->
        <h2 class="header sticky-header"><u>Update (Monday, Oct 14, 2024): DreamScape RPG (DreamScape level)</u></h2>
            <p class="par">I have gotten the idea to make a very small RPG game based on the original idea, and just seeing how I would want the game to play out. This RPG style of game will be connected to the universe of Dreamscape, but won't be what the final product will be. Think of it like a very very early experiment with the idea, and just testing the waters. I am also thinking of bringing this small game into the main game as a little easter egg or an actual playable level.</p>
            <p class="par">In order to make this RPG come to life, I intend to use PyGame. I want to have more experience with Python and how it connects to Game Development. Not only this but I am also interested in the idea of Game Design as well. The way the RPG will look is in the style of Undertale/Pokemon. Perhaps 5-7 rooms, and maybe 4 "bosses". I am not set on what the game will include, these are just starter ideas. I still need to look deeper onto the capabilities of PyGame, and see what I can and cannot do.</p>
